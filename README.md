## :bulb: Motivation
<p>I've participated of a programming event from Aura, where we did a lot mini projects but with much knowledge, principally for who is starting in web development like me. So this project is one of the five projects that the Alura team helped us to develop. They gave the base of the project and after they gave challenges for us to rebuild the project using our ideas, so there is it my idea, how I play much of CS:GO I dicided to do the scoreboard inspired in the game and after I developed the system to remove or add players, it's a simple project. Thanks Alura 😉</p>
